# Important things (Tech Check)
* Glenn will be the Tech Check person and be in the Tech Check studio. He will be the only one giving out links to the live studio
* Tech check is: add speaker to the stream, hear if you can hear them, see if you can see them, ask them to share the screen, after that we trust all is good
* **!!! GLENN WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT POST THE LIVE LINK IN THE PUBLIC COMMENTS !!!**

# Important things (Live)
* Make sure to press Go Live somewhere just before 9am, make sure to **NOT PRESS THAT AGAIN** before we are completely done.
* We probably mostly want to use the second to last layout in StreamYard (the two persons on the left and square on the right)
* You could play with changing some scenes whenever it makes sense, but I think we should mostly stick to the one mentioned above
* In the break remove everyone from the screen (incl. shared screens) and add a banner that is already setup that states whenever we will back

## Switch speaker procedure
0. See if you can connect with next speaker through private chat
1. Remove all sources from current speaker
2. Add all sources for next speaker
3. See if you can connect with previous speaker through private chat

## During stream
When you see the speaker join the live room try to connect with them through the private chat and see if they need anything. Double-check if they want you to interupt with questions or maybe collect some interesting quesions and handle them at the end of the session. Our assumption will be that they will keep an eye on the chat themselves or handle it any other way and we do not interupt.

Whenever you see something go wrong, try the **PRIVATE CHAT** first and see if they see that. If not, please add yourself to the stream to make yourself audible and let the speaker know. Only if there is something that is worth it.

After the session and you took them out of the stream you could connect again through the private chat and see how it went or something. Of course only after adding the next speaker to the stream.
