ðŸ‘‹ Hey there awesome person!

Thank you so much for being a part of the First International Test Driven Development Conference.
It is only because of the strange times that we live in that we have the honor to have some of you as a speaker.
This also means that we have to go virtual, like many other events. To facilitate this and not burden you with too much 
technicalities, we have decided to stream on YouTube and do that through [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/).

In this briefing we will talk you through some of the things you should know.

Small disclaimer; this is a first for us (as well) so it might not all go perfectly smooth, and to be honest; it doesn't have to be. This day is very much about having fun, socializing oh and some learning too :)

# TL;DR
Event: [TDD Conf 2021](http://tddconf.com) 10th July 2021

* Session time: Please check the schedule table below for how many minutes you have for your speak. The schedule is tight, please keep to the assigned time as much as humanly possible. Approaching to the end of your talk, we will warn you about how many minutes you still left.
* As long as you are not added to the stream by us you can't be seen or heard. The big screen in the middle is what is being broadcasted. This also means that you are not heard by us in the "backchannel". To communicate please use the **private chat**, that means **not the Comments** that is the public chat on YouTube.

* Live Broadcast studio link:  https://streamyard.com/wys45pv6dt
* Live Broadcast on YouTube to view the event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_noEVCR__I
* During the event we will have people watching and moderating the chat for inappropriate behavior. If you want us to help out with notable comments or questions, please reach out.
* After the stream and you're taken out of the broadcast, you can check in with us in the **private chat**, that means **not the Comments** that is the public chat on YouTube. But you can also just leave :)
* You are awesome, thank you for sharing your valuable time and content with us and the community.

# What is StreamYard?
StreamYard is an online application that allows us to host a live-stream without too much hassle.
Typically you would need some impressive hardware to do a live-stream, not to mention when you want to have guests on etc.
With StreamYard it's as easy as just going to a webpage, make sure that page has the right permissions to use your
microphone and camera and that you're allowed to share your screen.

If you'd like to get a taste of what's involved you can have a look at the [official docs](https://streamyard.com/resources/docs/guest-instructions/index.html)
or watch [this video](https://youtu.be/An5ko-YEp1o?t=892) (guest part starts at around 14 mins).

You can also go to the [Tech Check link](https://streamyard.com/sg6ngkeisy) at any time before the day of the event to check it
out yourself. The Tech Check link is not broadcasting anywhere and you won't be able to test _everything_ but you'll get a sense of what it does.

## Good to know about StreamYard
The good thing to know is that in StreamYard the big screen you see on top is the thing that is being broadcasted. As long
as you are not added to the stream by the producer (one of us, the organization) you won't be live. However, that also means
that you can't talk to each other through audio. If you're not added to the stream, the only way to communicate is through
the private chat that is available from within StreamYard.

While being live on the actual broadcast, note that there is a **public** chat (named Comments), which is selected by default and a **private**
chat. The public one is the one all the viewers on YouTube are seeing and can put messages in as well. If you need to communicate with the organization make sure you use the private chat, or just speak while you're live as someone will be listening.

# What do we want you to do
The important thing is: we will take care of all the speaker switching and setting up the right scenes etc. The only thing we expect from you is to be on time, be prepared and have a blast! Here is what to expect.

1. Please come into the [Tech Check link](https://streamyard.com/sg6ngkeisy) 15 min before your session starts. The schedule should reflect your local timezone. If you have doubts about that please reach out. The schedule should run from 07:00 PDT to 18:00 PDT (16:00 CEST - 03:00 CEST). There will be someone there to do some simple checks to see if your camera, audio and screen sharing works. This should ideally not take more than a couple of minutes. There you will also get the link to enter the actual live broadcast studio. That will bee the exact same app, but that one is a continuous broadcast to YouTube.

2. **Go to the live broadcast studio**. As mentioned before; as long as you are not added to the stream by a producer, you cannot be seen or heard. That means that you are free to join the live broadcast studio at any time, but at least 5 min. before your session is supposed to start. Keep you eye on the private chat inside of StreamYard. The producer will give you a heads-up on when they will add you to the stream and thus; when you will go live. Before that happens, double-check that your camera is visible, your audio is working and you can also already start sharing your screen. This is also not added to the stream directly. It goes without saying that you should not close the StreamYard browser windows during the stream. This is your connection to the broadcast.

3. **Do your magic!** Have fun! Do the thing and be awesome! How you want to go about the session is completely up to you. You can keep you eye on the chat yourself for questions, maybe take questions in the last few minutes, or not do questions at all. By default, we will try not to interrupt you unless some disaster happens. If you want us to interrupt for good questions or help you out in the last few minutes with some questions that we think should be highlighted during your session please reach out so we can make that work. Please try to stick to your assigned time, as much as possible.

4. Not so much a step you need to take, but a note: please don't be alarmed if you see other people popping in and out of the stream. I'm not sure that is visible for a guest, but if it is, we are probably hopping around studios trying to set something up or helping the next speaker. As noted before; unless something really bad happens we will hop online with you and let you know audibly that something is wrong, but that should not happen.

That's it! If you're missing something in this information please reach out to any of us or me directly.

Again thank you for spending your time with us, we highly appreciate it! We are planning to send you some appreciation gift related to the conference, but we are still in planning, we keep you updated and get in touch with you, really soon. Thanks again, see you soon! :)
